A variant of the ocean biome with dark indigo water at the surface. Like the cold ocean, it has a gravel seabed and squids swimming about. However, the water's surface is frequently broken up by patches of ice and large icebergs, consisting of packed ice and blue ice, and occasionally topped with snow blocks.\
**Fish**: Cod, Salmon
