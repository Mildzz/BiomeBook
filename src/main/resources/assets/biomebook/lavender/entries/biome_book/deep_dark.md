A dimly lit cave biome that generates deep underground mostly within the deepslate layer. It is largely sculk blocks upon all surfaces, with frequent sculk sensors and occasional sculk shriekers, which can directly summon a warden. An ancient city is a large structure that can generate here, containing chests with unique loot. No mobs aside from wardens spawn here.\
