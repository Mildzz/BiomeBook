This rare biome consists of a mostly flat island and has mycelium instead of grass as its surface. Mushroom fields are always adjacent to a deep ocean and are isolated from other biomes. It is one of the few biomes where huge mushrooms can generate naturally, and where mushrooms can grow in full sunlight.\
**Mushrooms**: Red, Brown
