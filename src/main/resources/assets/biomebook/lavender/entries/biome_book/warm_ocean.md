A variant of the ocean biome, with light teal water at the surface. Like the lukewarm ocean, it has a floor made of sand and like all oceans, it is populated with seagrass. Pufferfish and tropical fish spawn here. Unlike other ocean biomes, warm oceans allow for the generation of coral reefs and sea pickles.\
**Fish**: Pufferfish, Tropical Fish
