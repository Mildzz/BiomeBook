In contrast to the mostly flat and calm terrain of the savanna biome, this uncommon variant generates chaotic terrain, with gigantic mountains covered in coarse dirt and some patches of stone. The mountains in the windswept savanna are extremely steep, sometimes jutting out at 90-degree angles, making it almost impossible to climb.\
